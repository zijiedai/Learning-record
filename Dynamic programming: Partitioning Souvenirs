Problem Description:
Input Format: The first line contains an integer 𝑛. The second line contains integers 𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑛 separated
by spaces.
Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 20, 1 ≤ 𝑣𝑖 ≤ 30 for all 𝑖.
Output Format: Output 1, if it possible to partition 𝑣1, 𝑣2, . . . , 𝑣𝑛 into three subsets with equal sums, and
0 otherwise

Problem overview:
1\  If the total number is divisible by 3, and there exist 2 groups contaning elements whose sum is the target number,then 1.

First attempt:
   1\Let's denote V(i,j) as the maximum value that can be reached with first i items with weight limit j.
   2\
   Didn't come out a solution, I'm going to redo the previous problems and come back later.

Second Attempt:
   With some hints from others, I came out an idea. The solution will basically build from the algorithm of knapsack without
   repititions, which is included in the document "Dynamic programming-Knapsack".
   This method uses the same algorithm as the problem I mentioned above, ultilizing a 2-D array to store the maximum value that
   can be reached with first i items at the value limit V.

   Let's denote S as the total sum of the integers.
   If values S/3, S*2/3 appear in the 2-D board, then it means
